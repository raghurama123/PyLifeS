Following is the tentative syllabus. 

## Part 1: Python basics
- Check your computers, operating systems, Python installation/configuration, Jupyter notebooks
- Data structures, functions, loops, input/output, file handling
- Data visualization with matplotlib
- Data analysis with pandas

## Part 2: Scientific Programming
- Numpy & Scipy
- Modeling biological data with exponential and logarithmic functions, growth functions
- Solving differential equations with Python: Enzyme kinetics (Michaelis-Menten Enzyme Kinetics, Lineweaverâ€“Burk plot), Modeling infectious diseases (SIR model), Homeostasis

## Part 3: Introduction to Biopython
- Biopython data structures: Seq, SeqRecord, SeqFeature, and others. Reading and writing sequence data from and to different file formats using Biopython
- Sequence manipulation and analysis using Biopython: translation, reverse complement, sequence alignment, motif finding, and more
- BLAST searches and analysis using Biopython
- Sequence annotation tools and data visualization

## Part 4: Working with Biological Databases
- Overview of biological databases and their role in bioinformatics
- Retrieving and parsing data from common biological databases
- Sequence and annotation data from biological databases

## Part 5: Advanced Biopython Topics
- Genomics: Next-generation sequencing data
- Structural biology: parsing PDB files, working with structural data, and visualization
- Machine learning and data mining
- Bioinformatics workflows

## Evaluation:

3 x Combined theory and practicals test (best 2 will be considered)
